## Thoughts
I was cleaning up my GitHub and remembered that I had other projecs from the past! They are defintely not at the level that I want to be at right now, but they are defintely a start, a marking point to see how far my skills have improved since then. Launching new projects soon this summer! (Currently: June 13, 2023)
